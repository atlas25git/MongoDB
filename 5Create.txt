Creating Documents:
 - insertOne({})
 - insertMany([{},{},{}])
 - insert()
 - mongoimport -d cars -c carsList --drop --jsonArray

Working With Ordered Inserts:
 - Doesn't roll back the already inserted data automatically.
 - insertMany([],{ordered: false})
 - Now it continues to the part of doc, after the failed event.

Atomicity:
 - Transaction either succeeds as a whole, or is rolled back as a whole.

Importing data:
 - Json files can be imported.
 - On cmd navigate to json file path.
 - In the dir: $ mongoimport tv-shows.json -d movieData -c movies --jsonArray --drop
