#MONGODB:
1. Provides server as well as the db to store data and to run it on.
2. database->Collection->Documents.
3. These documents are analogous to tables in sql based dbs.
4. We can skip over the cumbersome joins to extract data, by embedding a document inside another.
5. One question might be about the efficiency since the data follows opposite of 
    SQL normalization i.e., storing data at seprate places.
    MongoDB though stores the data together but the efficient behind the scenes query mechanisms,
    make the operation efficient.
    As it saves time on complex joins and merges.

#INIT CMDs:

#SHELL VS DRIVERS:
